# AP_LinkedIn 
This is a windoes application , made similar to linked-in.<br/>
This was main project of advanced programming course in amir kabir university of tehran.<br/>
We made this app using tools like java,SQL, RES Tful api and javaFX to handle this app.<br/>
We used native libraries as possible to learn more.<br/>
Front end part is not completed, because we had no experience with javafx before. but backend and database management is fine.<br/>
A good feauture that our app provides, is jwt token.<br/>
Here is some pictures of it:<br/>
